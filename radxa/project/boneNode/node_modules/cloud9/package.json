  "readme": "**Issues on c9.io** If you have questions regarding the hosted service at [c9.io](http://c9.io)\nincluding issues with accounts or payments,\nplease file them at [support.c9.io](http://support.cloud9ide.com/home) rather than as a\nGitHub issue in this repository.\n\n# Cloud9 IDE\n\nCloud9 is an open source IDE built with [Node.JS] on the back-end and JavaScript/HTML5 on the client.\nIt is very actively maintained by about 20 developers in both Amsterdam and San Francisco and is one\ncomponent of the hosted service at [c9.io](http://c9.io). The version available here runs on your local system.\n\nCloud9 balances the power of traditional desktop IDEs with the simplicity and elegance of editors\nlike TextMate and Sublime.\n\nCloud9 is built entirely on a web stack, making it the most hacker-friendly IDE today.\nFork it, hack it, and if you think others would benefit, issue a pull request on this repo\nand we'll take a look. If you have any questions, meet us in #cloud9ide on irc.freenode.net\nor ask us on Twitter [@Cloud9IDE](http://twitter.com/#!/Cloud9IDE).\n\nHappy Coding!\n\n## Features\n\n  * High performance ACE text editor with bundled syntax highlighting support for JS, HTML, CSS and mixed modes.\n  * Integrated debugger for [Node.JS] applications with views of the call stack, variables, live code execution and live inspector\n  * Advanced Javascript language analysis marking unused variables, globals, syntax errors and allowing for variable rename\n  * Local filesystem is exposed through [WebDAV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) to the IDE, which makes it possible to connect to remote workspaces as well\n  * Highly extensible through both client-side and server-side plugins\n  * Sophisticated process management on the server with evented messaging\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWe support the newer versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\nIf installing on Windows, please refer to [Installation on Windows](#installation-on-windows-experimental).\n\nRequirements:\n\n  * NodeJS `>= 0.6.16`\n  * NPM `>= 1.1.16`\n  * libxml2-dev\n\nInstall:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9.git\n    cd cloud9\n    npm install\n\nThe above install steps create a `cloud9` directory with a `bin/cloud9.sh`\nscript that can be used to start Cloud9:\n\n    bin/cloud9.sh\n\nOptionally, you may specify the directory you'd like to edit:\n\n    bin/cloud9.sh -w ~/git/myproject\n\nCloud9 will be started as a web server on port `-p 3131`, you can access it by\npointing your browser to: [http://localhost:3131](http://localhost:3131)\n\nBy default Cloud9 will only listen to localhost.\nTo listen to a different IP or hostname, use the `-l HOSTNAME` flag.\nIf you want to listen to all IP's:\n\n    bin/cloud9.sh -l 0.0.0.0\n\nIf you are listening to all IPs it is adviced to add authentication to the IDE.\nYou can either do this by adding a reverse proxy in front of Cloud9,\nor use the built in basic authentication through the `--username` and `--password` flags.\n\n    bin/cloud9.sh --username leuser --password c9isawesome\n\nCloud9 is compatible with all connect authentication layers,\nto implement your own, please see the `plugins-server/cloud9.connect.basic-auth` plugin\non how we added basic authentication.\n\n## Installation on Windows (experimental)\n\nIf you're running Cloud9 on Windows you'll have to follow these steps as well:\n\n  * Install [Grep for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/grep.php)\n  * Add `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin` to your [PATH](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)\n  * Open a new instance of `cmd` with elevated rights (right click 'Run as adminstrator')\n  * Now follow the steps under 'Install'\n  * *Please note that the `npm install` fails due to a libxml error, but you can ignore that for now.*\n\nTo start Cloud9, please don't start through `bin/cloud9.sh` but rather via:\n\n    node server.js [args]\n\nPlease note that there will be errors displayed regarding the `find` command,\nand that some features might not work.\nFeel free to improve the Windows experience and open a pull request.\n\n## Updating\n\nTo update to the latest version (if this doesn't work, just make a fresh clone):\n\n    git pull\n    npm update\n\n`npm update` does not currently install missing dependencies. To do so use:\n\n    npm install\n\n## Open Source Projects Used\n\nThe Cloud9 IDE couldn't be this cool if it weren't for the wildly productive\n[Node.JS] community producing so many high quality software.\nMain projects that we use as building blocks:\n\n  * [async.js] by [fjakobs]\n  * [jsDAV] by [mikedeboer]\n  * [connect] by [senchalabs](http://github.com/senchalabs)\n  * [engine.io] by [LearnBoost](http://github.com/LearnBoost)\n  * [smith.io](http://github.com/c9/smith.io) by [creationix](http://github.com/creationix) & [cadorn](http://github.com/cadorn)\n  * [ace](http://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) by [fjakobs]\n  * [apf](http://www.ajax.org) by [ajax.org]\n  * and of course [Node.JS]!\n\nThanks to all developers and contributors of these projects!\n\n[fjakobs]: http://github.com/fjakobs\n[javruben]: http://github.com/javruben\n[mikedeboer]: http://github.com/mikedeboer\n[ajax.org]: http://www.ajax.org/\n[async.js]: http://github.com/fjakobs/async.js\n[jsDAV]: http://github.com/mikedeboer/jsdav\n[connect]: http://github.com/senchalabs/connect\n[engine.io]: http://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io\n[requireJS]: http://requirejs.org/\n[Node.JS]: http://nodejs.org/\n\n## License\n\nThe GPL version 3, read it at [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt)\n\n## Contributing\n\nCloud9 wouldn't be where it is now without contributions. Feel free to fork and improve/enhance Cloud9 in any way your want. If you feel that the Cloud9 community will benefit from your changes, please open a pull request. To protect the interests of the Cloud9 contributors and users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is the simplest of agreements, requiring that the contributions you make to an ajax.org project are only those you're allowed to make. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes ten minutes, and only needs to be completed once.  There are two versions of the agreement:\n\n1. [The Individual CLA](https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/raw/master/doc/Contributor_License_Agreement-v2.pdf): use this version if you're working on an ajax.org project in your spare time, or can clearly claim ownership of copyright in what you'll be submitting.\n2. [The Corporate CLA](https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/raw/master/doc/Corporate_Contributor_License_Agreement-v2.pdf): have your corporate lawyer review and submit this if your company is going to be contributing to ajax.org projects\n\nIf you want to contribute to an ajax.org project please print the CLA and fill it out and sign it. Then either send it by snail mail or fax us or send it back scanned (or as a photo) by email. Please indicate a contact person or pull request your CLA relates to so we can quickly process and handle your agreement. Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for subsequent submissions.\n\nEmail: CLA@c9.io\n\nFax: +31 (0) 206388953\n\nAddress: Cloud9 IDE\n  Keizersgracht 241\n  1016 EA, Amsterdam\n  the Netherlands\n",
