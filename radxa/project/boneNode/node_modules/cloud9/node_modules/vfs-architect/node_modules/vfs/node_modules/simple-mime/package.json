A common thing for node servers to do is serve static files over HTTP.\nThis requires, among other things, knowin the mime type you want to send.  Here is a simple module to make this easy.\n\n## Install\n\nIf you use NPM, then install this via npm.  Also, please remember to put it as a dependency in your package.json file of your module that requires it.\n\n    npm install simple-mime\n\nIf you choose to not use npm, or can't use it in your environment, then simply copy the single file `simple-mime.js` to somewhere you can require it.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply load this library, configure your fallback mime type, and query it for the mime type of various filenames.\n\n    var getMimeType = require('mime')('application/octect-stream');\n    var file = \"/bar/foo/baz.mp3\";\n    var type = getMimeType(file);\n\n## Goal\n\nYou will probably not use this except as a dependency to your own module that deals with serving files over HTTP, or some other protocol that requires mime types.\n\nThis doesn't have as many features as the `mime` module in npm, but it's a lot simpler too.  The goal is that it's useful to someone.\n",
